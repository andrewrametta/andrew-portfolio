          <h2>My Journey to becoming a software developer...</h2>
          <p>As a student at Thinkful, my journey is only just beginning. My path to becoming a software developer has been one with a lot of twist and turns along the way. My journey started first working in the church. After graduating seminary I decided being a pastor wasn't for me and made the natural transition to folding yoga pants. I worked at Lululemon for several years before then making my way to the nonprofit world to become a fundraiser. Along the way I became a yoga teacher and have been practicing yoga for over 10 years.</p>
          <p>Throughout my journey, helping people has always been my motivation for what I was doing. This is also the reason I decided to become a software developer. I believe that programming gives me the tools to help make people's lives better in a real and practical way.</p>
          <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I am excited to be part of a team that is helping make the world a better place.</p>
